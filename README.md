### Key Process Steps

1. **Compliance Check**
   - Validates user's IP address from request headers
   - Supports multiple proxy headers (X-Forwarded-For, Proxy-Client-IP, etc.)
   - Currently supports Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan
   - Logs compliance events for audit purposes

2. **Balance Verification**
   - Checks user's USDC wallet balance
   - Ensures sufficient funds before proceeding
   - Locks funds to prevent double-spending

3. **Payment Authorization**
   - Integrates with Hong Kong card provider
   - Maximum transaction limit of $1000
   - Simulates network latency (200ms)

4. **Reconciliation**
   - Runs every 30 seconds
   - Checks pending transactions
   - Updates status to SETTLED or FAILED
   - Releases funds on failure

### Transaction States

- **NEW**: Initial state when transaction is created
- **PENDING**: Payment authorized, waiting for settlement
- **SETTLED**: Payment successfully completed
- **FAILED**: Payment failed, funds released

## IP Detection and Filtering Patterns

Robust IP detection and filtering are essential for controlling access to services, especially in regulated environments like fintech or virtual card payment systems. Below are key architectural and operational patterns for IP detection and enforcement.

### **1. Network-Level IP Filtering**

- **Firewall Rules & Security Groups:**  
  Use network firewalls or cloud security groups to allow or block traffic based on source IP addresses. This is the first line of defense and prevents unauthorized traffic from ever reaching your application.

- **API Gateway Filtering:**  
  Modern API gateways (e.g., Envoy, AWS API Gateway) support IP allowlists/denylists, which can be configured to check the original source IP before routing requests to backend services.  
  - Example: Envoy's `ClientTrafficPolicy` can extract the client IP from headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, considering trusted proxy hops.

### **2. Application-Layer IP Validation**

- **Middleware Checks:**  
  Implement IP validation logic within your application's middleware. This allows you to apply business-specific rules, such as only allowing certain endpoints to be accessed from specific IP ranges.

- **Header Parsing:**  
  For applications behind proxies or load balancers, extract the client IP from trusted headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`). Ensure you only trust these headers if set by your infrastructure to prevent spoofing.

### **3. Pattern-Based and Dynamic Filtering**

- **Pattern Sets:**  
  Some platforms allow you to define pattern setsâ€”collections of IPs or ranges to match against incoming requests. These can be updated dynamically and evaluated via custom expressions or policies.

- **Geolocation and Risk-Based Filtering:**  
  Enhance IP checks with geolocation or risk scoring (e.g., blocking high-risk countries or known bad actors). This is common in compliance-driven systems, where you may need to prevent access from sanctioned regions.

### **4. Allowlist and Denylist Strategies**

- **Allowlist (Whitelist):**  
  Only explicitly approved IPs/ranges can access the service. This is highly secure but requires careful management to avoid locking out legitimate users.

- **Denylist (Blacklist):**  
  Block known malicious or unwanted IPs, allowing all others. This is easier to manage but less secure, as new threats may arise from unlisted IPs.

- **Priority and Rule Management:**  
  Some systems allow you to set the priority of allowlist and denylist rules, ensuring, for example, that denylist entries always override allowlist ones if there's a conflict.

### **5. Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Logging and Auditing:**  
  Log all denied or suspicious requests for compliance and forensic analysis. This is critical in regulated environments.

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Continuously monitor and update your IP lists and patterns based on new intelligence, business changes, or compliance requirements.

### **Example: Envoy Gateway IP Detection Pattern**

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClientTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: enable-client-ip-detection
spec:
  clientIPDetection:
    xForwardedFor:
      numTrustedHops: 1
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: eg
```

### **Summary Table: IP Detection and Filtering Patterns**

| Pattern Type         | Description                                                       | Use Case                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Firewall/Security Group | Blocks/permits traffic at the network edge                      | First line of defense               |
| API Gateway Filtering   | Enforces IP rules before requests reach backend services         | Centralized, scalable enforcement   |
| Application Middleware  | Business logic validation, dynamic rule application              | Fine-grained, endpoint-specific     |
| Pattern Sets            | Dynamic, expression-based matching of IPs/ranges                 | Easily updated, flexible policies   |
| Allowlist/Denylist      | Explicitly permit or block IPs; can be prioritized               | Compliance, high-security scenarios |
| Geolocation Filtering   | Block/allow based on country or risk profile                     | Regulatory compliance, fraud risk   |

**Best Practice:**  
Combine network-level filtering with application-layer checks and dynamic pattern management for defense-in-depth. Always ensure IP extraction is trustworthy, especially when using headers behind proxies. Regularly review and update your rules to adapt to evolving threats and compliance needs.
